# Java COMPSs Algorithms

Some algorithms developed in Java COMPSs with or without using the HDFS's API developed in this project.


-----
In this repository there are the following algorithms:

1. K-Means (Implementation provided by COMPSs) ;
2. K-Means with HDFS;
3. [K-NN  Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm);
4. K-NN with HDFS;
5. [SVM Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine);
6. SVM with HDFS;




## How to compile

Fist of all, it's necessary to import the [HDFS's integration](https://github.com/eubr-bigsea/compss-hdfs) into the project. 

Second, compile it. If you prefer use Maven, you can use the pom file in this project.


## How to Run a Application
 
Before execute a code, remember to start the HDFS:

> $HADOOP_PATH/sbin/start-dfs.sh

After that, just use runcompss as usual.
