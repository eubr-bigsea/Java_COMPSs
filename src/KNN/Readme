== Description ==

K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In k-NN classification, an object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.

The optimal choice of the value k is highly data-dependent: in general a larger k suppresses the effects of noise, but makes the classification boundaries less distinct.


== Versions ==
There are two versions of KNN, depending on the file's system where the data was stored.
== Version 1 ==
''files'', where the files are stored as usual.
== Version 2 ==
''HDFS'', where the files are stored in the HDFS.


== Execution instructions ==
Usage:
runcompss KNN.files.KNN    -K <K value> -f <num frag> -t <train datafile> -v <test datafile>
runcompss KNN.HDFS.KNNHDFS -K <K value> -f <num frag> -t <train datafile> -v <test datafile>


where:
		 * - K value: integer number used into the classification
		 * - num frag: number of nodes used on the execution
		 * - train datafile: File's path used to train the model
		 * - test datafile: File's path to classification


== Execution Example ==
runcompss 	KNN.HDFS.KnnHDFS -K 3 -f 2  -t /user/hdfs/train_data.csv -v /user/hdfs/test_data.csv
